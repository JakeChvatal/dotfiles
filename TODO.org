  this will be part of my move to nixos
:END:
everything should be separated ::
- exwm / emacs things
- vim + ranger + modular 'unix-like' things
this should probably be done when moving to nixos.
* TODO let s-* keyboard shortcuts through in the firefox mode
* TODO emacs :: make a org capture template to save a link and add a note to it
* TODO emacs :: block audio ctrl and f-keys from firefox
* TODO emacs :: fix wttrin, fork package and load manually
* TODO emacs :: hopefully make config literate at some point!
this is good for documentation and for ensuring the code is good quality
* TODO make sure that vim and emacs cfg have same behavior
* TODO make sure that vim and tmux (headless) cfg use same kbd shortcuts
