#+TITLE: Dotfiles
*DEPRECATED*: I've now switched to using NixOS on my systems.
You can find that configuration here: [[https://github.com/jakechv/nix-cfg]]

Configuration files for my Arch Linux system.

* Installation
These files are managed by GNU Stow.
To install files on your system:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/jakechvatal/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
stow {pkg}
#+END_SRC
, where {pkg} is the package with the associated configuration to install.
